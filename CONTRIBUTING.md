## How to contribute to pyMBE
Create a fork of the repository and submit your contribution in the form of a pull request.
Give your branch a short and meaningful name, and start your work from the most recent commit on the main branch.
Any new version of the code must reproduce all the data stored in `testsuite/data`.
Before pushing your code, run `make tests` to execute the full test suite,
`make pylint` to check for code issues, and `make docs` to confirm sphinx can build the user guide.
When rapidly prototyping code, run `make unit_tests` periodically to check for regressions.
All new code will be reviewed by at least one member of the pyMBE development team before being merged into the main branch to ensure that a functional version of the code is always available.
Class methods are sorted in alphabetical order.
We follow semantic versioning and keep a changelog.

## Community standards
We aim to keep the pyMBE community an open and friendly space for researchers to collaborate in developing tools for building coarse-grained models of polyelectrolytes and biomolecules. 
We adhere to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) v2.1 to provide guidelines on the expected behaviour of the members of our community, which we hope it contributes to a healthy and a positive enviroment for our developers and users.
